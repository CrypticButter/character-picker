#+TITLE: Character Picker for Windows

[[file:doc/images/theta.png]]

A quick and convenient pop-up interface that allows you to search for and type Unicode characters.

* Installation

The ready-made files can be downloaded from the [[releases][releases page]] (choose =character-picker-YY-MM-DD.zip=).

The =exe= file must be run in the same folder as the =characters.txt= file.

In order to be useful, you should bind a keyboard shortcut to execute the character
picker so that you can quickly access it anywhere on demand. For instance, you could
download [[https://www.autohotkey.com][AutoHotKey]] and create a script (=.ahk= file) that runs on
system startup.

Here is an example of such a script:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  ; Runs the program when Ctrl+Win+Space is pressed
  ; Also see: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm
  ; Important to set the working directory to the same folder as the `characters.txt` file

  #^Space::
    SetWorkingDir c:\Users\luis\mdata\util\character-picker
    Run "C:\Users\luis\mdata\util\character-picker\picker.exe"
    Return
#+END_SRC

After installing AutoHotKey, you can double-click the script file for the shortcuts to
take effect. Then, you can create a shortcut to this file (Ctrl+Shift+drag) and move it to the =Start-up=
folder which can be accessed by typing =shell:startup= into the Run box (Windows+R).

* Usage

While the program is open, your keystrokes will be captured by the search box.
The [[https://github.com/quickwit-inc/tantivy][search]] allows exact matches using double quotes (e.g. =​"latin capital"​= ),
as well as basic natural query language (e.g. =​(greek AND letter) OR "latin capital"​= ).
Note that you may need to type in an entire word before getting any matches.

To type a character, you can click on it or press =Enter= to type the selected character.

To change the selection, use the keybindings =Ctrl+h= (left), =Ctrl+j= (down), =Ctrl+k= (up) and =Ctrl+l= (right).

To close the window, click the cross, press =Escape=, or press =Ctrl+g=.

You can resize the window and scroll the results if needed.

* Configuration

The =characters.txt= has the following format:

- One line per character
- Each line consists of the character, then a space, then a description

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  Δ GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA
#+END_SRC

These descriptions power the search function, so you can modify the description of a character to make it easier to search for.
Additionally, you can remove lines with any characters that you do not want to show up, or simply start afresh with a minimal list of useful characters.

* Building from Source

This character picker is a simple Rust program that can be built using =cargo=.
Note that it depends on a custom version of the =druid= crate found [[https://github.com/LuisThiamNye/druid][here]].

The =characters.txt= file can be generated from the =DerivedName.txt= file which can be [[https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedName.txt][downloaded]] from the Unicode website.
Then, execute =extractor/extract_chars.clj= in the same directory using, for instance, [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka][Babashka]].
